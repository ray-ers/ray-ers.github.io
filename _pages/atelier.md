        <center>This collection is a personal one. These photographs are not just my favorites—they are markers of change. Through them, I trace my journey in photography, my approach to storytelling, and the path of my own self-discovery.

        <p>This photograph marks the moment 'intentional' photography took form in my mind. It is the convergence of a certain place at a certain time—with equipment ready, and an awareness of the story waiting to be told. Some might call this luck; I call it deliberate intention.</p>
            <br>
        <p>And it was at this time that I found beauty in watching us, as human beings, in our daily existence. From the highest peaks of our accomplishments to the quiet grace of daily routines, I wish to have them all. Maybe it is the appreciation for life itself, however human-centric. Admittedly, I never take pride in capturing nature and landscape pictures.</p>
