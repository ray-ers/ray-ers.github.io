  This photograph marks the moment 'intentional' photography took form in my mind. It is the convergence of a certain place at a certain timeâ€”with equipment ready, and an awareness of the story waiting to be told. Some might call this luck; I call it deliberate intention.

  And it was at this time that I found beauty in watching us, as human beings, in our daily existence. From the highest peaks of our accomplishments to the quiet grace of daily routines, I wish to have them all. Maybe it is the appreciation for life itself, however human-centric. Admittedly, I never take pride in capturing nature and landscape pictures.
