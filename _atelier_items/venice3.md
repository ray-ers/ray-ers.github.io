description: "And finally, there is the honor of the subjects themselves. They move through the world, sharing moments of their existence, often unaware of the camera's gaze. I am a guest in that moment, and I have a profound gratitude for what they share. To me, every photograph represents a silent agreement: they offer a moment of truth, and in return, I have a duty to honor their privacy and dignity. Protecting their story is fundamental to protecting my own integrity and the sanctity of the viewer's experience."
