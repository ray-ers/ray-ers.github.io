description: "I’ve found my most resonant work emerges from a difficult, necessary solitude. While I enjoy the comfort of company when traveling, it's in being alone that the real dialogue begins—an honest reckoning with my own thoughts. This discomfort exposes the imperfect aspects and confronts the irrational self. Yet those raw emotions are the very fuel for a burning desire to communicate, to express, and to memorize."
